My name is Neil Robinson and I am a Chartered Professional Accountant.

I am an expert in Canadian taxation with specialization corporate income tax, personal income tax, sales taxes. Furthermore, I have 8 years experience in a public accounting setting with strong financial accounting, auditing, and analytical abilities. I have a passion for financial numbers and helping individuals meet their financial goals.

Most of my experience includes helping successful small businesses and wealthy individuals with their business and personal taxes.

I have a strong understanding of Accounting Standards for Private Enterprises(ASPE), and Public Sector Accounting.

I also have a love for technology and in my spare time I tinker with technological projects such as creating databases, websites(like this one) and developing simple programs to complete tasks.

When I am not on my computer youâ€™ll find me at the yoga studio practicing hot Power Vinyasa Yoga.
