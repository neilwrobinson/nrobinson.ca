I am in the process of reading Dreyer's English by Benjamin Dreyer. There are a lot of inconsistencies and oddities in English, and the author goes into great detail, in a fun and charming way, by providing crisp and concise ways of describing many common pitfalls of grammar. It is a great book to boost your confidence in your writing.

Grammar books are often dry, but Benjamin provides amusing cases and examples to make grammar lessons memorable. I highly recommend giving this book a read.
