I joined a local Toastmasters club to practice my verbal communication. At first, I wasn't sure if I should join program because I didn't know what to expect. However, I am glad I participated as a guest to get a feel for what this program is.

The style of meetings and all the different roles give you the opportunity to practice many different styles of communication: impromptu extemporaneous speaking, conducting meetings, being positive, confidence body language, feedback, filler word elimination, and all sorts of other minor things you don't think of but is necessary when conducting yourself in a public view.

Overall, I feel like I know I should be doing these things I listed above, yet I don't seem to be able to do it consistently. I am looking forward to the opportunity to practice these skills on a consistent basis with constructive feedback.

And I joined the club since it is a perfect place to start my journey; and it is a journey that I have been consciously ignoring and procrastinating for a long time. Because I was afraid. I do not like doing these things, but more and more opportunities are coming my way to speak, and I have knowledge I want to pass on, which is usually in a verbal public speaking setting or delivery. I want to be more confident and persuasive to get the results I want in my professional life.

I am on track to improve verbal communication goal in 2025.

Next up practice my ice breaker.
