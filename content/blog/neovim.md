I started using Neovim for the past couple of months. It is a steep learning curve, and
it is painful to write code because I have to keep thinking about going into edit mode.
The pain rapidly subsides whenever I discover a faster way to insert, delete, or replace 
a block of text or characters. Here's an example, if I press the character d then shift-$, it will delete all the 
characters from the active cursor position to the end of the line. 

My favourite motion keys are w and b; w goes one word forward, and b goes one word backward. 

The undo action is simple too, it is just u.

Making all caps or all lower case is only a few key strokes. For example,

press g + U and then pressing w will change the word from lower case to upper case, or vice-versa
pressing g + u and then press w will change the word from Upper to all lower case. 

There is much to learn still and each time I use it, I get faster and more fluid and purposeful. 

You should give it a shot.
