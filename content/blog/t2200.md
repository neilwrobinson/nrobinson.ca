T2200.ca was launched in early November, and rather than an official launch it was more of a test.
Each week I have been making updates to the site to enhance just a little each day. Small incremental
changes were done to slowly build it up. I guess this is an Agile approach. Pushing a lot of updates 
over the course of time makes the journey easier as all the small changes begin to add up.

The biggest hurdle or challenge was the windows application itself. There are probably 4500 lines 
of code, and it is difficult to test and ensure the PDF is filled correctly as there are roughly 
80 inputs for each form. A smaller and more nebulous challenge was errors: What if a person has bad 
data in the Excel spreadsheet and they import it, and didn't realize the error. I had to build out
many common scenarios to catch common errors, mostly with dates.

I am happy with the result and the challenge it brought. Now I can say I tried it and launched it. 

The T2200 generator will save time. But the big test we'll see in the coming years whether or not 
saving time matters in large organizations.
