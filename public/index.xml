      <description>I attended a Intro to Xero workshop today. I learned that cloud accounting is the way of the future and not moving forward with this trend maybe costly if you do not merge your clients to the cloud. The promise of the cloud is working with one data on one platform which allows for a better connection with clients because you can always check in with clients as they are going through the bookkeeping process rather than at year end.</description>

      <description>Introduction To become a yoga instructor, you most certainly spent a lot of your time, energy and not to mention your hard-earned “cash” for yoga instructor training. You completed the training, and you earned respect and experience to become a professional yoga instructor. As a result, you are now making money as a yoga instructor at one or multiple yoga studios. So the question is, how does a yoga instructor report their earnings on their personal tax return?</description>
